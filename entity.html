Based on the information provided, we can create an Entity-Relationship (ER) model for the gymnasium system. Here's a representation of the model:

Entities:

Gymnasium ID (unique identifier)
Name
Address
Telephone Number
Member:

Member ID (unique identifier)
Last Name
First Name
Address
Date of Birth
Gender
Session:

Session ID (unique identifier)
Type of Sport
Schedule
Maximum Capacity
Coach:

Coach ID (unique identifier)
Last Name
First Name
Age
Specialty
Relationships:

Registers:

Member ID (foreign key referencing Member entity)
Gymnasium ID (foreign key referencing Gymnasium entity)
Attends:

Member ID (foreign key referencing Member entity)
Session ID (foreign key referencing Session entity)
Conducts:

Session ID (foreign key referencing Session entity)
Note: The "Registers" relationship represents the registration of a member at a specific gymnasium. The "Attends" relationship represents a member attending a specific session. The "Conducts" relationship represents a coach conducting a specific session.

This ER model provides a basic structure for managing gymnasiums, members, sessions, and coaches. Further details, such as additional attributes or relationships, can be added based on specific requirements.
